# Solar-Irradiance
With the spirit of reproducible research, this repository contains all the codes required to produce the results in the manuscript:

> M. Jain, N. Jain, N. Sinha and S. Dev, Identifying Relevant Meteorological Variables For Estimating Solar Irradiance In Ireland. (under review)

### Executive summary
In this paper, We try to find and analyze the essential featuresr required for forecasting solar irradiance in Dublin, Ireland with the help of feature selection methods, namely, filter methods, wrapper-based methods and Embedded based method. 

### Environment 
This project was tested on `python 3.8` using a `Windows 10` environment.

### Scripts
+ `Filter method- Correlation based method.py`: This file contains the code for Correlation Based Method for feature selection.
+ `Wrapper method - Backward elimination using p-value.py`: This file contains the code for Backward elimination using p-value for feature selection.
+ `Embedded Method - Lasso Regression method.py`: This file contains the code for Lasso Regression Method for feature selection.
+ `req.txt`: This file contains list of all the libraries required for this project.
